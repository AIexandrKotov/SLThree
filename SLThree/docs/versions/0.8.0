------ 0.8.0 Binding&Naming Update ------ [~.~.~]
Language:
    - New method definition syntax
      `[modifs][Name][<T>](args) {...}`
      `[modifs][Name][<T>](args) => value`
    - You can now implements contexts with ":" in the following cases:
      - New initializers:       // [] - optional
         `new T [Name][: Ancestors][{...}]`
      - New context creators:
         `context [Name][: Ancestors] {...}`
         `new context [Name][: Ancestors]`
    - Statement-like notation (without `;`) for expressions with body:
        condition, match, context, new, methods
    - Constructor method that creates new contexts
       `context TBase { constructor = (f) => this.f = f; };`
       `T1 = TBase(5); T2 = TBase(10);`
    - The right side of the nested context initializer
      assignations now always refers to the self context
       `x = 1; context A { context B { x = x; }}`
    - Parent keyword in constructed contexts
       `T1.parent == TBase;`
    - Abstract methods (withoud body)
    - Static expression (will be executed only once) `static x`
    - Condition statement is now expression
    - Using statement is now expression
    - Strong method binding
    - Changed context syntax:
       `new context Name: T {...}` -> `new T Name {...}`
       `new context: T {...}` -> `new T {...}`
       `new context Name: T` -> `new T Name`
       `new context: T` -> `new T`
       `new context Name {...}` -> `context Name {...}`
       `new context {...}` -> `context {...}`
Optimization:
    - Executing method performance has been increased by ~10%
    - Wrappers refactoring, minumum 3x faster wrapping
      minimum 20x faster unwrapping
Bugfixes:
    - Fixed object invokation (#125)
