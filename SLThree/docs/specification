--=== SLT SPECIFICATION ===--
Nums (default 64 bit), chars, strings (+interpolated) and bools like in C#
Suffixes for nums determine type like in Rust (1u32 = uint, 1f32 = float)
Operators (priority like in C#):
    Binary: + - * / % == != > >= < <= = += -= *= /= %= => as
    Unary: + - ! ~
    Primary: x.y, x(), new x()
Statements like in C#:
    - if and while
    - return, break, continue
Almost like in C#:
    - using <Type>; // not namespace
    - switch (supports non-const in case and break not needed)
    - [implicit] <lambda definition> - implicit supports more types (slower)
SLThree features:
    - getting lexems (<lex> as is) and call it
